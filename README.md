Some default theme overrides that I like. These are loaded in Obsidian by:

1. Open Settings.
2. Under Appearance → CSS snippets, select Open snippets folder (folder icon).
3. In the snippets folder, create a CSS file that contains your snippet.
4. In Obsidian, under Appearance → CSS snippets, select Reload snippets (refresh icon) to see the snippet in the list.

Available CSS variable overrides are found [here](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/CSS+variables).

All overrides must be within the body definition.
